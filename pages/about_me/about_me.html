                        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                            <h2>Γειά σου!<sup class="small-sup"><a href="#[4]">(4)</a></sup></h2>

                                <p>My name is André, I'm from São Paulo, but thanks to job opportunities, I've lived in some and visited many other cities in Brazil. This sparked my interest in the most diverse cultures, both from within the country and abroad, which resulted in my interest in studying other languages.</p>

                                <p>I have a degree in Industrial Automation and Electronics from SENAI.</p>

                                <p>SENAI (National Service for Industrial Training) is a private Brazilian institution of public interest, non-profit, with a legal personality under private law, outside of the public administration. It was named by the United Nations (UN) in 2014 as one of the main educational institutions in the Southern Hemisphere
                                <sup class="small-sup"><a href="#[1]">(1)</a></sup>. The technical courses offered by SENAI are similar to the Associate Degree Programs in the United States. In other words, you can graduate from a course and pursue a career with ease, but it also prepares you to pursue a bachelor's degree.</p>

                                <p>The course I took is called Technical in Industrial Automation and Electronics. This course qualifies me to develop and integrate solutions for industrial automation systems, integrate solutions for industrial automation systems and develop solutions for industrial automation systems<sup class="small-sup"><a href="#[2]">(2)</a></sup>.</p>

                                <p>To make the text more concise, I will include the complete curriculum of the courses I took along with my resume in <a href="../cv/cv.html">Curriculum Vitae</a>.</p>

                                <p>Because of my ease with complex infrastructure and mathematics projects, I ended up working in the civil construction area. I even took a technology course related to road works. In civil construction, I learned more about budgets and financial engineering. And also to be very meticulous with details, since lack of attention could cause losses and even fatalities.</p>

                                <p>But my dream has always been to pursue a career in electronics, technology and especially robotics. I am currently studying for a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the Virtual University of the State of São Paulo (Univesp). It is equivalent to a Bachelor's Degree in the United States.</p>

                                <p>This course allows me to With this comprehensive training, the professional can specify, design, implement, integrate, test and maintain hardware and software systems and, thus, work on the development of products, applications and services in any area of ​​computing and information technology, meeting the demand of industries, companies, financial groups, research and development centers, universities, educational institutions and the public services sector<sup class="small-sup"><a href="#[3]">(3)</a></sup>.</p>

                                <p>The bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and the technical degree in Automation are courses that dialogue quite well, because the technical degree gave me the experience in designing and implementing the hardware and software part, and the bachelor's degree now gives me the opportunity to design these same parts. These courses qualified me in the theoretical part, and the professional experiences I had allowed me to put this knowledge into practice.</p>

                                <p>In order to be able to demonstrate this knowledge, I had the idea of ​​creating this page. My goal is to show what I have learned and what I am capable of, but I also want to practice everything I have learned and be able to share this knowledge.</p>

                                <p>To name the page, I used the name of a great mathematician from Antiquity: Hypatia of Alexandria. His story and his works inspire me a lot. I will explain this in a separate article.</p>

                                <p>I hope that this experience that I will provide you with will be interesting for you, the reader.</p>
